# JARQL
SPARQL construct queries on JSON files

JARQL allows to execute SPARQL Contsruct Queries against JSON files.  The project was inspired by [Tarql](https://github.com/tarql/tarql) which provides similar functionality for CSV files. With JARQL you can easily transform JSON Documents to RDF.

## Usage

TBD

## Current limitations

 * Nested arrays in JSON are not support
 * The order of JSon Arrays is irrelevant
